# Variables and Data type
# Variables. Like a container cup. You can keep anything, even variable itself. 
# Remember find the value of x in Highschool? x was a variable. x + y = 10, x - y = 5

x = 10
a = 12
c = 13677
b = a

# Data types. For now [string, number, boolean]
# Python is dynamically typed. You don't have to specify data type

# String/Text types

x = "This is text line string"
u = "T"
k = "This is text line string"
f = "  "
f = " "

# Integer type
y = 10 #int  
m = 23 #int
l = 82 #int

#float type
w = 10.601290 #float
w = 10.00 #float
w = 10.9999999 #float


#bool type
a = True #bool 
k = False #bool


# Truethy consideration
a = True #truthy value
a = 1000 #truthy value
a = 5.5 #truthy value
a = 1 #truthy value
a = "Machine Learning" #truthy value
a = "LLM" #truthy value
a = " " #truthy
# any non zero 
# any non empty data structure
# any non string data


# Falsy considerating
b = False #falsy value
b = 0 #falsy value
b = 0.0000 #falsy value
b = "" #falsy value
# any empty data structure
# any empty string


#python identifier
# identifiers are used for identification of variables, functions, classes, modules, objects

# Rules for python identifier declaration
# (a-z,A-Z,0-9, _)
# must start with letter. Also _
# Can not start with digit
# case sensitive. mishkat & MISHKAT & Mishkat & MishkaT & misHKat all are different



















#output in console
print('1')
